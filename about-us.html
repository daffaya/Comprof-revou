            <div class="paragraph-wrapper">
              <p>
                When thinking about our distinctive Culture and how we operate as an
                Organization, we asked ourselves two fundamental questions:
              </p>
              <p>
                1. What is uniquely particular about RevoU?
                <br />
                2. What is it that our employees experience here, that they won't
                experience elsewhere?
              </p>
              <p>
                In answering such questions, we first came up with a list of
                industry standard values. Values that, despite being an integral
                part of our culture, we share with many other employers in the job
                market. Especially the ones we compete with to attract the very best
                talent, that is other tech start ups.
              </p>
              <p>
                These are values such as:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Collaboration &amp; teamwork
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Integrity
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Customer centricity
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </p>
    
              <p>
                For as much as we shouldn't take these for granted, we believe that these are not what make us truly unique. Not what we fully aspire to. Not the ones to keep ourselves accountable in our day-to-day life at RevoU to pursue our vision to make RevoU the most inspiring and career defining place to work in Southeast Asia.
              </p>
    
              <p style="font-weight: bold;">
                So, what are the distinctive values that makes us uniquely RevoU?
